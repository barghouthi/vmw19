# VMW 2019 talk by Aws Albarghouthi

This repository includes the slides and code used in the I used at the [verification mentoring workshop (VMW 2019)](http://i-cav.org/2019/mentoring/) in NYC.

- The slides are in `vmw19.pdf`
- The Jupyter notebook is `vmw19.ipynb`
- You will need to install Z3: `pip install z3-solver`

The talk is based on this [blog post](https://barghouthi.github.io/2017/04/24/synthesis-primer/).
